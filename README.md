# Simmy
Simmy is a chaos-engineering and fault-injection tool, integrating with the Polly resilience project for .NET.  It is expected to release in early 2019 and will work with Polly v7.0.

## Concept

_These grabs of slides from our recent conference presentations represent concept - final syntax will be confirmed in documentation but all features are in scope for launch_

## Further information

For background on the original proposal for a fault-injection dimension to Polly, see [the original issue on the Polly repo](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/issues/499).

See the [v0_1 branch](https://github.com/App-vNext/Simmy/tree/v0_1) for the latest Simmy code.  Prior to a [Polly v7.0 release on nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Polly/7.0.0), Simmy can still be trialled right now, using a nuget build from the [v7.0 branch of Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/tree/v700).   

See [Issues](https://github.com/App-vNext/Simmy/issues) for latest discussions as we bring Simmy towards release!
